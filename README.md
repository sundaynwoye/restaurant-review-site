# Restaurant review site - OpenClassrooms
### Step 1: Restaurants
Start with the real foundation of your application. There will be 2 main sections:
* A Google Maps map loaded with the Google Maps API
* A list of restaurants on the right side of the page that are within the area displayed on the map
The Google Maps map will focus immediately on the position of the user. You'll use the JavaScript geolocation API. A specific color marker should be shown at the user's current location.
A list of restaurants is provided as JSON data in a separate file. Normally, this data would be returned to the backend of your application by an API, but for this exercise, it's sufficient just to load the list of restaurants directly into memory!
### Step 2: Add restaurants and reviews
* Add a review about an existing restaurant
* Add a restaurant by clicking on a specific place on the map
### Step 3: Integration with Google Places API
